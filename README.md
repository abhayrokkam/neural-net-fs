# From Scratch: Neural Networks and Back Propogation

Learning Resource: [LINK](https://youtu.be/VMj-3S1tku0?si=qfz9OuDRKSzVn2nY)

    Note: All the `helper_xyz` folders have code that were directly copied from the learning resource. 

## Prerequisites
- I start by importing the ***visualization functionality from the learning resource***. For this, I create a `helper_draw` folder from which I will be able to import `draw_dot` function from the learning resource.

## Basic Functionality
- Create a `Value` class with basic functionalities of initialization, representation, addition and mulitplication.
- Add the functionality of "memory" where the resulting `Value` item will remember the children `Value`/s involved in the operation used to produce it.
